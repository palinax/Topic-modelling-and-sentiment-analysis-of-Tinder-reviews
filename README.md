The objective of this project is to extract relevant customer feedback and user sentiments regarding popular online platform for second-hand fashion trading. For that purpose, I applied topic modelling and sentiment analysis to get valuable insights into customer experiences. By understanding the underlying user sentinent and common feedback themes, Vinted can make informed decisions to enhance user satisfaction, improve service quality, and maintain a competitive edge in the online marketplace.
