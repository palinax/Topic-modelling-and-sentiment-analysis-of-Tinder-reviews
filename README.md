# Topic modelling and sentiment analysis of Tinder reviews

## About the project 


The objective of this project is to extract relevant customer feedback and user sentiments regarding the popular dating application, Tinder. Given the controversial nature of the app and its inclusion of paid features, it is essential to gauge user feedback before considering enrollment in the premium version. To achieve this goal, I used topic modeling and sentiment analysis techniques. By leveraging topic modeling and sentiment analysis, valuable insights about user opinions and experiences with Tinder were obtained, helping potential users making informed decisions about their engagement with the app, particularly concerning its paid features.

## Data

The dataset was obtained by scraping 10000 latest reviews about Tinder from Google Play store using
[google-play-scraper](https://pypi.org/project/google-play-scraper/)
